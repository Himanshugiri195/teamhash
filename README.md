 Abstract :
 TEKMUX-2019
PROBLEM SUMMARY
Objective
Smart solution for predictive analysis and medication support using epidemiology of
citizens /diseases/geography.The application should be able to assist policy makers
to provide better health services in the affected area.
Goals
A proper analysed data for better understanding of health for the policy maker for
health.
A platform for the analyst to have a better idea of affected people
Medication support using epidemiology of citizens.
Better health services in affected area.
Solution objective
The app would help the government bodies to get an estimated idea of people
affected at various levels in the country.
The app would help the policy makers in achieving the same goal at a greater speed
with the help of a more centralised database.
App would be able to help in developing the health policies according to the need of
the regions of different areas.
Software and technologies used
1.Flutter. for the android and iOS app to have uniformity.
2. Mongo db , mochajs , mongoose for the backend
3. Leaflet js for web map api
4.Google Map api for flutter map
5.Google Big Data Analytics
TEKMUX-2019
Project Outline
• The app is created using flutter.Flutter is Google's mobile app SDK
for crafting high-quality native interfaces on iOS and Android in
record time. Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers
and organisations around the world, and is free and open source.
• The database is designed using mongodb. MongoDB is an opensource document database and leading NoSQL database.A core
function of MongoDB is its horizontal scalability, which makes it a
useful database for companies running big data applications.
• The maps are designed using leaflet js . Leaflet is the leading
open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive
maps. It works efficiently across all major desktop and mobile
platforms out of the box.
• The maps in the app are made using google map api . The google
map enables the developer to plot all the statical data on the map
in order to represent the real world scenario.
• Google Big Data Analytics can be used for analysis of the data of
the affected people and graphs and calculations can be performed
based on that.

ACTOR
1.POLICY MAKER
The person who makes policy for the general masses .This include people of
the government who are responsible for making law and regulation for any disease
control.The government bodies can use the app to make laws by analysing the
situation based on different data entry and records.
2.AFFECTED PERSON
The person who is affected by the disease.Data of people affected by the
various disease is stored in the database based on both user side input and
government side input and is stored for further analysis.
3. ANALYSTS
They deal primarily with patient records and create statistical data and reports.
These reports guide healthcare organisations as they make adjustments based on
disease and treatment trends, quality of care, expenses and income.
4.DOCTOR AND RESEARCH UNITS
Is a professional who practice medicine and is responsible with promoting
curing and restoring health.The doctors can use the app to study the pattern and
data of the affected mass and could work on the same to improve the condition.
